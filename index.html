          <p class="mb-5">Hi my name is Pranav Sudheer. I am currently a 9th grader in South Brunswick High School. <br> During school, I love to code, eat, and participate in sports, my favorite being basketball.<br>Even though I have been in robotics for only a year, I was able to learn to widen my building capabilites and become the captain of the shadow team, Zeus (or team Z).</p>

              <p>I have only been on the robotics team for less than a year now but that doesn't mean that I am worse. In my season on robotics this year, I competed with two teams, 750R and 750Z. For the 2018-2019 game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDDGBcs0TFM" target="_blank">Turning Point</a>, I was able to compete in about 7 competitions one of them being states. For 3 competitions, I was able to compete as captain and driver of team Z. For the other 4 competitions, I competed with 750R as a scout(helping scope out other teams to help later on in the scrimmage stages).</p>

              <p>Hackathons, or programming competitions, are places where I can go test myself out against people of higher calibers and learn new things I wouldn't have if I didn't go. It also helps perpare me for the real world and how coding affects the outside world and isn't just a class you can take. Finally, it is a new place and, like all new places, it comes with new people, allowing me to build new relationships and meet more people.</p>

                    <p>On 750Z I have multiple roles. One of those roles is co-captain. Another role is a builder.</p>
                    <h4>Co-Captain</h4>
                    <p>As co-captain I need to help teach and guide the other members about robotics and the information I know and they don't. However, being co-captain is also a learning experience. I was able to learn different things that I wouldn't have known without those team members. Being a co-captain I gain a lot of knowledge from other captains as well as other teams in general. It also allows for me to increase my leadership skills and public speaking skills.</p>
                    <h4>Builder</h4>
                    <p>As a builder I help plan and create a lot of the componenets on our bot. Being a builder I am able to increase my skill in building and widen my view on robotics. On our bot I was the one who came up with the idea for an entire geared intake because of our lack of certain parts. I was also the lead in making the shooter, a main and important part of our bot.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
          <p>Other than robotics, I enjoy to do other things for fun. I enjoy playing sports and other outdoor activities. Some of these activities include basketball and mountain biking at different and new locations. Indoors I enjoy playing video games and eating food. I enjoy playing first person shooter games and trying new foods that other people may believe are weird.</p>
